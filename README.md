# gomoku

A gomoku game implemented with Meteor framework

Install:
`npm install`

Run:
`npm run start`

Play at: http://localhost:3000

Others can go to `http://[your ip number]:3000` to log in and play.


There is still a lot to expand on here but the core of the game is in place.
Like:
- Be able to play a 15x15 Gomoku game against an opponent over the internet.
- Make sure you can only play in one game at the time and only place stones when it's your turn.
- The game ends when one player gets five (or more) in a row or when there are no more empty places to place your stone.
- Game session and users are stored in a database.
